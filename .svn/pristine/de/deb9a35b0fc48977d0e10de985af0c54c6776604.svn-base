\title{Galton's peas}
\description{
In a paper presented to the Royal Institute on February 9, 1877, Sir Francis Galton discussed his experiments on sweet peas in which he compared the sweet peas produced by parent plants to those produced by offspring plants. In these experiments he could observe inheritance from one generation to the next. Galton categorized the parent plants according to the typical diameter of the peas they produced.
